Informal care refers to the support provided by family members, friends, and volunteers to individuals who need help with their daily activities due to physical or mental limitations. While informal care is an essential component of the care system, it can also be a challenging and overwhelming experience for the care team, particularly when it comes to managing information and communication.

Enter Focused Care, a passion project developed to support a multidisciplinary team in informal care. The project uses React as the frontend and Firebase as the backend to provide a centralized platform for all the information and communication needed to care for an individual.

The main goal of Focused Care is to make life easier for care teams by providing a single place for all the information they need to provide the best possible care. With Focused Care, care team members can view the individual's medical information, care plan, and treatment history all in one place, making it easier to stay on top of the individual's needs. This can help improve communication between team members, reducing the likelihood of miscommunication and ensuring everyone is on the same page when it comes to the individual's care.

Focused Care also provides a platform for care team members to communicate with each other and share information. This is particularly important in informal care, where care is often provided by a group of people who may not see each other regularly. With Focused Care, care team members can communicate easily and keep each other updated on the individual's care, reducing the likelihood of misunderstandings and ensuring everyone is aware of the individual's needs.

Another important aspect of Focused Care is its user-friendly interface. The platform is designed to be easy to use, with intuitive navigation and clear information displays. This makes it easier for care team members to access the information they need and reduces the likelihood of frustration and confusion. The platform is also mobile-friendly, so care team members can access the information they need on-the-go.

In conclusion, Focused Care is an innovative project that brings together the power of modern technology to support the care of individuals who need it. With its centralized platform, user-friendly interface, and focus on communication, Focused Care has the potential to make a real impact in the world of informal care. By providing a single place for all the information and communication needed to care for an individual, Focused Care can help care teams work more efficiently, effectively, and compassionately, making life easier for everyone involved.
