As a designer at Flanders Investment and Trade, I have had the opportunity to make a real impact on the event experience for both attendees and organizers. My work has centered around streamlining the UX of the event platform and designing new features to make the process of registering for events and promoting companies easier and more efficient.

One of my proudest achievements was streamlining the UX of the promotion step in the event wizard. This not only gave users a better experience when registering for events, but it also gave them the option to reuse previously used data like images and texts about their companies, making the process even more convenient.

Another exciting project I worked on was designing and developing the pdf brochure generation for promotion events. These brochures not only looked great, but they also helped to promote events and provide attendees with all the information they need.

I also had the opportunity to design the buyer selection portal, a portal built as an extension on top of the promotion platform that is intended to be used by external organizers for fit events. With this portal, organizers can easily accept or reject companies to attend their events, making the process of curating events much simpler.

Finally, I helped design the "My Promotions" tab, which allows users to easily see when and how they were promoted by fit and to see their general texts and media to be used in fit promotion events. This feature gives users a central location to view all of their promotion information and makes it easy for them to track their progress.

In conclusion, I am thrilled to have been a part of the team at Flanders Investment and Trade, where I have been able to help create a better event experience for everyone involved.
